# Tackling-Scale-Free-Networks
## Currently working on this
## Introduction 
This project focuses on understanding why various networks (social, communication, technological, biological) display similar features. The goal is to explore if these features can be explained by basic principles that govern the construction of these networks.

#### What are Scale Free Networks ?
A network whose degree of distribution follows the power law. That states that the fraction P(k) of nodes in the network having k connections to other nodes goes for large values of k as
P(k) âˆ¼ k^-(gamma)
where gamma is the scaling parameter. This means that few nodes have many connectionswhereas many nodes have little to no connections.

## Methodology followed 
1. Generating Scale Free Networks
2. Visualising Scale Free Networks
3. Applying ML Algorithms to the networks
